# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

**Warning:** Features marked as *alpha* may change or be removed in a future release without notice. Use with caution.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-09-19

### Added

- The `--http-host-whitelist` flag has been added to the serve command, to which a list of hosts can be passed. If at least one host is passed, access to streamed HTTP/HTTPS publications will be restricted to the provided hosts. A host like example.com can be further restricted to a "folder", such as example.com/the/path/
- The `--http-unsafe-requests` flag has been added. It disabled restrictions that are enabled by default to prevent access to private IP addresses (such as internal infrastructure or localhost), and should be used with caution

### Fixed

- The software version displayed when using the `--version` command was incorrect due to a bug. Thanks @tefkah for the fix

### Changed

- Dependencies were updated

## [0.4.0] - 2025-07-30

### Changed

The WebPub data the go-toolkit parses and provides has been updated to more closely match the latest WebPub spec. Pay close attention to these changes if you depend on the WebPub output in reading systems/libraries that use an older version of the spec!

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-12

### Changed

- Major changes to `readium serve` [command syntax](https://github.com/readium/cli/blob/develop/docs/serve.md), to improve ease of use
- Docker container no longer includes any test publications, an only enables http/https publication serving by default
- Improvements to documentation
- Updates to dependencies

### Fixed

## [0.2.1] - 2025-06-08

### Added

- Add `--s3-use-path-style` flag to enable broader support for S3-like services that use the deprecated path-style bucket access (especially useful in docker environments)

### Fixed

- The version output from the CLI was incorrect, consisting of the go-toolkit version. [It is now](https://github.com/readium/cli/pull/32) a combination of the CLI and go-toolkit version

## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-21

### Added
