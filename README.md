This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

The Readium Playground is using the following configuration:

- Go-Toolkit on Google Cloud Run
- Playground App on CloudFlare Worker
- Assets e.g. demo EPUBs stored on Google Cloud Storage

To deploy, the following script is run: 

```bash
npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages@1 && npx wrangler pages deploy ./.vercel/output/static
```

Itâ€™s running with defaults, which means a commit triggers a build and deploy for the current branch to preview. You can then access the app from a subdomain using this branch name. 

More details in [the @cloudflare/next-on-pages repo](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages).

## Icons

The [Material Symbols and Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) are used as SVG (with default settings, outlined) but support for icon fonts may be added in the future.
