# Collapsibility and Visibility

The concept of collapsibility applies to Action Triggers e.g. Settings, Fullscreen and ToC actions in the top end corner, or docking options in sheets/containers. 

It is relying on a global `collapse` property, and a specific `visibility` property for each of these actions.

## Collapsibility

When using collapsibility, you can configure how actions should be rendered i.e. as an action icon, or a menu item in an overflow menu.

The `collapse` value can be:

- `false` to disable collapsibility entirely – in this case the overflow menu won’t be used;
- `true` to enable collapsibility based on the actions’ `visibility`;
- an object whose properties are in enum `ThBreakpoints` and values can be:
  - the `number` of icons to ideally display, constrained by the actions’ `visibility`;
  - keyword `all` as an alias for the total number of actions – in this case the overflow menu won’t be used.

In the following example, the collapsibility logic will try to display 2 action icons on the smaller breakpoints, including the overflow menu icon. 

```
actions: {
  ...
  collapse: {
    [ThBreakpoints.compact]: 2,
    [ThBreakpoints.medium]: 2
  }
}
```

Note this object don’t require all `ThBreakpoints` to be configured, only the ones requiring a specific setting.

The visibility set for actions has priority though. An Action whose `visibility` is set to `always` can’t be collapsed. This means that, in the example above, if two actions are set to `always`, then `collapse` can’t display only 2 action icons.

## Visibility

Each action can set its own `visibility`, in enum `ThCollapsibilityVisibility`:

- `always`: the action should always be displayed as an action icon;
- `collapsible`: the action should be displayed as an action icon or a menu item depending on `collapse` configuration;
- `overflow`: the action should always be displayed as a menu item.

For instance:

```
[ActionKeys.fullscreen]: {
  ...
  visibility: ThCollapsibilityVisibility.partially
}
```

This means the Fullscreen action trigger will be migrated into the overflow menu depending on your `collapse` configuration.

```
[ActionKeys.jumpToPosition]: {
  visibility: ThCollapsibilityVisibility.overflow
}

This means the Jump To Position action trigger will always be displayed as an overflow menu item.
