# Using the Core Package

The Core package provides the foundational building blocks for creating reading applications. It includes UI components, custom hooks, helper functions, and utilities for preferences management.

## Installation

Thorium Web relies on peer dependencies to work. You must install them manually.

```bash
npm install @edrlab/thorium-web @readium/css @readium/navigator @readium/navigator-html-injectables @readium/shared react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit i18next i18next-browser-languagedetector i18next-http-backend motion react-aria react-aria-components react-stately react-modal-sheet react-resizable-panels  
```

## Package Structure

The Core package is organized into several sub-packages:

- `@edrlab/thorium-web/core/components`: UI components for building interfaces
- `@edrlab/thorium-web/core/hooks`: React hooks for EPUB support, accessibility, and responsive design
- `@edrlab/thorium-web/core/helpers`: Utility functions for common tasks
- `@edrlab/thorium-web/core/lib`: Redux store and related utilities (hooks and reducers)
- `@edrlab/thorium-web/core/preferences`: Preferences management system
