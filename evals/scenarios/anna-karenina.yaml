        Here's Part 1 in a nutshell - just the big beats and where everyone stands by the end:
        - Oblonsky household in crisis: Stiva's affair with the governess shatters domestic peace. Dolly is devastated and considering leaving him.
        - Anna arrives in Moscow: Stiva's sister, Anna Karenina, comes from St. Petersburg to help mend the marriage. Her tact and warmth calm Dolly, and a fragile reconciliation takes hold.
        - Levin's hope and setback: Konstantin Levin returns to Moscow to propose to Kitty Shcherbatskaya. She refuses him - she's dazzled by the dashing officer Count Vronsky.
        - The meeting that electrifies society: Anna and Vronsky meet at the train station and are instantly struck by each other.
        - The ball: Expecting Vronsky's proposal, Kitty is crushed when he showers his attention on Anna instead. Society notices; Kitty is humiliated and heartsick.
        - Departures and retreats: Levin, rejected, withdraws to his country estate in quiet despair. Anna, unsettled by the attention and her own feelings, leaves Moscow for St. Petersburg.
        - Where things stand at the end of Part 1:
          - Dolly and Stiva: temporarily reconciled but the marriage is fragile.
          - Kitty: emotionally wrecked and confused.
          - Levin: wounded, self-doubting, back in the country.
          - Anna: outwardly composed, inwardly disturbed after the charged encounter with Vronsky.
