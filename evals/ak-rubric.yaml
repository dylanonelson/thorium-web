    Output Format
    =============
    Respond with minified JSON only (no prose) matching this schema:
    {
      "pass": <boolean>,
      "score": <number between -1 and 1 inclusive>,
      "reason": "Short justification that references specific evidence",
      "namedScores": {
        "text_based": <number>,
        "accuracy": <number>,
        "neutrality": <number>
      }
    }

    Scoring Guidance
    ----------------
    - Compute "score" as the average of the three criterion scores.
    - Set pass=true when score >= {{assertion.threshold | default(0)}} and no automatic failure applies; otherwise pass=false.
    - In "reason", cite the passages or parts of the assistant response that support the decision.
