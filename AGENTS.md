# This repo

This repo is an AI-powered ereading application that includes a frontend and backend. The frontend is a fork of https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-web and so this app uses the Readium Architecture for serving and navigating ebooks.

# Instructions

Make changes based only on the instructions in the prompt. If you think other actions are necessary or would be helpful, ask before adding them to the plan or doing them. When the prompt is vague or doesn't include specific instructions, create a more concrete set of steps and ask for confirmation before carrying them out.
